## Tasks 🥇

We chose three tasks across three modalities, all of which are useful in the global fight against the climate crisis:

1. **📝 Detecting climate disinformation 📝:** based on text from news articles.
2. **🔥 Classifying regions at risk of wildfires 🔥:** based on image data gathered via satellite.
3. **🌳🪓 Detecting illegal deforestation 🌳🪓 :** from bio-acoustic data recorded in the jungle

The datasets for each task will be hosted on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/).

## Task Partners 

*We will announce more details about the tasks and release the datasets in the coming weeks!*
